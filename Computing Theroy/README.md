### 1. What is a Language
A language is a set of strings formed from an alphabet Σ. <br>

Example: <br>
$
Σ = \{a, b\}  \\
L = \{ab, aab, abb\}
$

### 2. What is Regular
A system is said to be regular if it can be described by finite means — i.e.,
it can be accepted by a finite automaton.
** draw its DFS **

### 3. What is a Regular Language
A regular language is any language that can be expressed by:
- a regular expression, or
- accepted by a finite automaton (DFA/NFA), or
- generated by a regular grammar (right-linear or left-linear).

🧩 Theorem equivalences: <br>
If 𝐿 is regular, then
𝐿 = 𝐿(𝑟) = 𝐿(𝑀) = 𝐿(𝐺) where <br>
- 𝑟: regular expression
- 𝑀: finite automaton (NFA/DFA)
- 𝐺: regular grammar

### 4. What is a Regular Expression
- A regular expression is a symbolic notation describing a set of strings (a language).
- Not a language

- Primitive expressions:
    - ∅ → empty set
    - λ → empty string
    - a → single symbol from Σ
- Recursive rules:
    - If r1, r2 are regular expressions, and so are
    - 1. union: r1 + r2 
    - 2. concatenation: r1r2
    - 3. Kleene closure: r*


### 5. What is a Regular Grammar
- used to describe a language 
- A regular grammar is a grammar 
𝐺 = (𝑉,𝑇,𝑆,𝑃)
    - 𝑉: finite set of variable
    - 𝑇: finite set of terminals
    - 𝑆: 𝑆 ∈ 𝑉 start variables
    - 𝑃: finite set of production rules
 such that all productions are either:
 - right and left linear grammar: use right is more simple (if it is left the use reverse operation with right)
 - linear: the variable change to is at most 1
 A -> aA, on the left side only at most one variable A

## Process
1. NFA to DFA
2. regular expression to NFA
3. NFA to regular expression
4. regular grammar to NFA
5. NFA to regular grammar
